## When a feminist sorority takes over the house next door, two desperate parents make an unholy alliance with their former frat boy enemy in a battle that proves girls just wanna have fun—loudly.

Just when Mac and Kelly Radner think they've finally reclaimed peace in their neighborhood, a new kind of party animal moves in next door. This time, it's Kappa Nu, a rebellious sorority determined to throw their own wild parties without frat house rules. With their house in escrow and potential buyers on the line, the Radners must find a way to shut down the sorority before their sale falls through.

Desperate for help, they turn to an unlikely ally—Teddy Sanders, their former frat-boy nemesis. But these fearless young women aren't going down without a fight, leading to an all-out prank war filled with chaos, clever schemes, and unexpected twists. *Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising* delivers bigger laughs, wilder parties, and a surprising dose of heart in this battle of the generations.
