## Description

What if everything you ate had feelings—and a seriously twisted sense of humor? *Sausage Party* takes you inside the world of Shopwell’s supermarket, where food dreams of being chosen by humans and taken to the fabled "Great Beyond." But when a sausage named Frank and his friends discover the terrifying truth about what happens after checkout, they embark on a wild, profanity-filled journey to escape their fate.

With outrageous humor, over-the-top action, and no topic off-limits, this R-rated animated comedy is anything but kid-friendly. Featuring a star-studded voice cast and packed with shocking twists, *Sausage Party* serves up a hilariously raunchy adventure unlike anything you've seen before.
