## Cocaine, shoulder pads, and hostile takeovers collide as a band of Wall Street outsiders scheme their way to the top, triggering the worst stock market crash in history.

Black Monday is a dark comedy that dives into the chaos of Wall Street in the 1980s, exploring the wild and cutthroat world of finance in the lead-up to the infamous stock market crash of October 19, 1987. Created by Jordan Cahan and David Caspe, the Showtime series blends outrageous humor, high-stakes drama, and sharp social commentary to deliver a fast-paced, unpredictable ride through the excess and corruption of the financial world.

Led by Don Cheadle's charismatic and morally dubious Maurice Monroe, the show follows a group of underdog traders—including the ambitious Blair Pfaff (Andrew Rannells) and the sharp-witted Dawn Darcy (Regina Hall)—as they challenge Wall Street's old guard. Packed with betrayals, shady deals, and outrageous antics, Black Monday doesn't just offer a hilarious take on finance; it exposes the greed, power struggles, and absurdity of the industry in a way that feels both exaggerated and eerily real.
