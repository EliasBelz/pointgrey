## When a young man faces cancer with a coin-flip chance of survival, his crude best friend, neurotic mom, and rookie therapist prove laughter might be the best medicine—even when death isn't funny.

What would you do if you had a 50/50 shot at survival? For Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a mild-mannered 27-year-old radio journalist, life takes a sharp turn when he's diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. With an unreliable girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), an overbearing but loving mother (Anjelica Huston), and an eager but inexperienced therapist (Anna Kendrick), Adam navigates the emotional rollercoaster of treatment. Through it all, his loudmouthed but fiercely loyal best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) is determined to keep things light—even if that means using Adam's illness as a pickup line.

Loosely based on writer Will Reiser's real-life battle with cancer, 50/50 blends heart, humor, and raw emotion into a refreshingly honest take on friendship, illness, and resilience. As Adam grapples with mortality, betrayals, and unexpected connections, the film delivers laughs and gut punches in equal measure.
