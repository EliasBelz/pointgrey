## Description

For over a decade, best friends Ethan, Isaac, and Chris have spent every Christmas Eve together in search of the ultimate holiday party—the legendary Nutcracker Ball. But with adulthood creeping in—Isaac about to become a father, Chris focused on his rising fame, and Ethan struggling to move forward—the trio decides this will be their last wild night together. Armed with a secret invitation to the elusive event, they set out on a chaotic, drug-fueled, and unexpectedly heartfelt adventure through New York City.

As the night unfolds, their friendship is tested through absurd run-ins, unexpected revelations, and a bizarre yet wise drug dealer who seems to know more than he lets on. *The Night Before* is a raunchy yet touching comedy that blends outrageous humor with an endearing story about growing up, letting go, and the true spirit of friendship.
