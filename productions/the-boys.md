## Description
The Boys is a gritty, darkly satirical take on the superhero genre, subverting traditional hero tropes by exposing the corruption, corporate control, and unchecked power of "Supes" in a world where superpowers are commodified. Developed by Eric Kripke and based on the comic book series by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, the show follows a group of vigilantes, The Boys, as they wage a brutal, underground war against Vought International and its flagship superhero team, The Seven.

The series delivers a blend of high-octane action, razor-sharp humor, and biting social commentary, tackling themes of power, media manipulation, and celebrity culture. Led by Karl Urban’s ruthless yet charismatic Billy Butcher and Jack Quaid’s reluctant but determined Hughie Campbell, the ragtag team must navigate betrayals, secret weapons, and morally gray decisions in their quest to dismantle the superhero-industrial complex. Meanwhile, Antony Starr’s chilling portrayal of Homelander, the unhinged leader of The Seven, adds a terrifyingly unpredictable antagonist to the mix.
