In *Pineapple Express*, Dale Denton, a process server and marijuana enthusiast, accidentally witnesses a murder by drug lord Ted Jones and corrupt officer Carol Brazier.

Fleeing for their lives, Dale and Saul end up on a wild journey, evading capture through car chases, high-speed escapes, and a series of misadventures.
