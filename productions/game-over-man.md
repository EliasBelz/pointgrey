## Description

When their luxury hotel is taken over by terrorists, three underachieving housekeepers (Adam DeVine, Anders Holm, and Blake Anderson) suddenly find themselves as the last hope to save the hostagesâ€”including a billionaire investor who could change their lives. With no training, no backup, and plenty of bad ideas, these misfit heroes have to fight back using whatever ridiculous tactics they can muster.

Packed with over-the-top action and raunchy comedy, *Game Over, Man!* is a wild ride from the creators of *Workaholics*. If *Die Hard* met *Workaholics* in the most absurd way possible, this would be it!
