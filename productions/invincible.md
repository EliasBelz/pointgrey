## When a teenager inherits his dad's superpowers, he discovers that family secrets can be deadlier than any supervillain and heroism comes with a bloody price tag.

Invincible is a bold, visceral, and emotionally charged animated superhero series developed by Robert Kirkman, based on his comic book of the same name. Premiering on Amazon Prime Video, the show follows 17-year-old Mark Grayson (voiced by Steven Yeun), who discovers that he has inherited superpowers from his father, Omni-Man (J.K. Simmons)—the most powerful superhero on Earth. As Mark embraces his new identity as Invincible, he soon realizes that being a hero is far more complex and dangerous than he ever imagined.

The series masterfully balances coming-of-age storytelling with brutal, high-stakes action, offering a fresh yet uncompromising take on the superhero genre. Unlike traditional animated superhero shows, Invincible doesn't shy away from intense violence, moral dilemmas, and shocking twists, delivering an emotionally resonant narrative that keeps viewers on edge.

With a stellar voice cast—including Sandra Oh, Walton Goggins, Gillian Jacobs, and Mahershala Ali—Invincible explores themes of legacy, betrayal, and personal growth while deconstructing the idealized superhero mythos. Packed with heart, humor, and jaw-dropping action sequences, the series is a must-watch for fans of both superhero media and thought-provoking storytelling.
