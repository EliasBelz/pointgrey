What follows is a wild adventure involving mishaps, a viral scandal, and a quest for self-discovery.

Premiering at SXSW and receiving positive reviews for its performances and humor, *Joy Ride* is a journey of friendship, identity, and the cultural complexities of being an adoptee in modern times. Directed by Adele Lim, the film mixes sharp comedy with heartfelt moments, offering a fun and empowering experience.
