## Description

When three sixth-grade best friends—Max (Jacob Tremblay), Lucas (Keith L. Williams), and Thor (Brady Noon)—get invited to a "kissing party," they embark on an outrageous adventure to prepare for their big moment. But after accidentally breaking Max’s dad’s drone while spying on teenage girls, the boys skip school to find a replacement, setting off a chaotic chain of events involving stolen drugs, frat house fights, and an epic freeway chase.

Directed by Gene Stupnitsky in his directorial debut, *Good Boys* is a laugh-out-loud coming-of-age comedy produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Packed with raunchy humor, heartfelt moments, and an endearing look at childhood friendships, the film was both a critical and commercial success, grossing over $111 million worldwide.
