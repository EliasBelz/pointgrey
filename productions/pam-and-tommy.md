## Description
Pam & Tommy is a biographical drama miniseries that chronicles the whirlwind romance and tumultuous marriage between actress Pamela Anderson and Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee. Starring Lily James as Anderson and Sebastian Stan as Lee, the series delves into the infamous unauthorized leak of their private honeymoon tape, a scandal that reshaped celebrity culture and internet privacy in the 1990s.

Based on Amanda Chicago Lewis’s 2014 Rolling Stone article, the series was created for Hulu by Robert Siegel and produced by Point Grey Pictures and Annapurna Television. Initially, James Franco was attached to direct and portray Lee, but the project was later restructured, with Craig Gillespie directing the first three episodes. The show was filmed in Los Angeles between April and July 2021.

Premiering on Hulu on February 2, 2022, Pam & Tommy garnered critical acclaim for its performances and storytelling, receiving ten Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series. It explores themes of privacy invasion, media exploitation, and the rapid rise of the internet, all through the lens of a scandal that changed the way celebrities and their personal lives were consumed by the public.
