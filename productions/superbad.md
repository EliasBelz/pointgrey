## Plot

*Seth* and *Evan* are high school seniors on the verge of graduation, determined to party and lose their virginity before going off to separate colleges. Seth promises to buy alcohol for a party hosted by his crush, *Jules*, and recruits their awkward friend *Fogell*, armed with a fake ID, to help out. But things go wildly wrong as Fogellâ€™s fake ID causes chaos, and Seth and Evan end up entangled with two bumbling cops, Officer Slater and Officer Michaels.

As the night spirals into absurdity with underage drinking, stolen cars, and a series of unfortunate events, Seth and Evan clash over their future, while Fogell becomes an unlikely hero. By the end of the night, the trio makes their way to the party, only to face more embarrassing moments and surprising revelations about their friendships and futures.
