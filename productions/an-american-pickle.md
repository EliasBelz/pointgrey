## When a man preserved in pickle brine for 100 years meets his app-developing great-grandson, their family reunion becomes a hilarious culture clash between old-world traditions and modern tech.

*An American Pickle* tells the quirky and heartwarming tale of Herschel Greenbaum (Seth Rogen), an Eastern European Jewish immigrant who, after falling into a vat of pickles in 1919, wakes up 100 years later in modern-day New York City. Struggling to adapt to the modern world, Herschel is reunited with his great-grandson, Ben (also played by Seth Rogen), who is a struggling app developer. The unlikely duo embarks on a journey filled with humor, familial conflict, and self-discovery.

Directed by Brandon Trost in his solo debut, the film blends comedy and drama with Rogen's masterful dual performance. It explores themes of identity, family legacy, and the clash between the past and the present. Released as HBO Max's first original film, *An American Pickle* garnered positive reviews for its charm and humor.
