## When two hapless journalists score an interview with a dictator, the CIA turns their career breakthrough into history's most ridiculous assassination plot.

In this outrageous political satire, TV host Dave Skylark and his producer Aaron Rapaport land the interview of a lifetime with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. What should have been a career-defining moment takes a wild turn when the CIA recruits them for a top-secret missionâ€”to assassinate the dictator. As they travel to Pyongyang, the duo finds themselves caught in a chaotic web of international intrigue, absurd antics, and unexpected friendships.

Packed with explosive action, dark humor, and over-the-top comedy, *The Interview* is a bold and hilarious take on media, power, and the absurdity of global politics. With James Franco and Seth Rogen leading the charge, this film delivers a riotous mix of satire and spy-thriller chaos that keeps audiences laughing and guessing until the very end.
