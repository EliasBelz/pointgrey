## Description

*An American Pickle* tells the quirky and heartwarming tale of Herschel Greenbaum (Seth Rogen), an Eastern European Jewish immigrant who, after falling into a vat of pickles in 1919, wakes up 100 years later in modern-day New York City. Struggling to adapt to the modern world, Herschel is reunited with his great-grandson, Ben (also played by Seth Rogen), who is a struggling app developer. The unlikely duo embarks on a journey filled with humor, familial conflict, and self-discovery.

Directed by Brandon Trost in his solo debut, the film blends comedy and drama with Rogenâ€™s masterful dual performance. It explores themes of identity, family legacy, and the clash between the past and the present. Released as HBO Max's first original film, *An American Pickle* garnered positive reviews for its charm and humor.
