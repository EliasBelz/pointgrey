## Description

*Cobweb* is a chilling horror film directed by Samuel Bodin in his directorial debut, based on a screenplay by Chris Thomas Devlin. The film tells the story of Peter, a shy, bullied eight-year-old boy who lives with his overprotective and emotionally distant parents, Carol and Mark. Strange tapping noises begin to emanate from the walls of his bedroom, and Peter discovers that he is communicating with a voice from behind the wall, which claims to be his older sister, Sarah.

As the terrifying truth unfolds, Peter learns that his parents had imprisoned Sarah after she was born severely deformed, and now, she plans to exact revenge on him. *Cobweb* combines psychological horror with a twisted family drama, leading to a suspenseful and unsettling conclusion. Starring Lizzy Caplan, Woody Norman, Cleopatra Coleman, and Antony Starr, the film explores themes of fear, manipulation, and family secrets.
