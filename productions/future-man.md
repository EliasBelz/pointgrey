## When beating an impossible video game turns you into humanity's chosen savior, saving the world means one janitor, two future warriors, and a whole lot of awkward time travel shenanigans.

Josh Futterman (Josh Hutcherson) is a janitor by day, gamer by night, and an all-around underachiever—until the impossible happens. After beating Biotic Wars, a video game deemed unbeatable, two mysterious warriors, Tiger (Eliza Coupe) and Wolf (Derek Wilson), appear from the future with shocking news: the game was actually a recruitment test, and Josh is now humanity's last hope against an impending apocalypse. Armed with minimal skills, crude humor, and a whole lot of bad decisions, Josh embarks on a chaotic, time-traveling mission to rewrite history and save the world.

Produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, Future Man is a wild, R-rated sci-fi comedy packed with absurd action, pop culture chaos, and no-holds-barred humor. From botched time-travel attempts to bizarre alternate realities, Josh and his team fumble through history, meeting historical figures, making catastrophic mistakes, and somehow surviving it all. With hilarious performances and a gleefully irreverent take on classic sci-fi tropes, this series is a must-watch for fans of Back to the Future, The Terminator, and off-the-wall comedy.
