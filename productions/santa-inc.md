## At the North Pole's most toxic workplace, one ambitious elf's quest to shatter the candy cane ceiling proves the cutthroat corporate world has nothing on Christmas.

Santa Inc. is an irreverent, stop-motion adult animated Christmas miniseries that satirizes the holiday season with a sharp comedic edge. Created by Alexandra Rushfield and produced by Point Grey Pictures and Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, the eight-episode series debuted on HBO Max on December 2, 2021.

Blending holiday cheer with biting social commentary, Santa Inc. follows Candy Smalls (voiced by Sarah Silverman), the highest-ranking female elf at the North Pole. After Santa’s heir apparent is lured away by Amazon, Candy sets her sights on becoming the first-ever female Santa Claus. However, breaking through the North Pole’s traditionalist glass ceiling proves to be no small feat, as she faces workplace politics, outdated traditions, and plenty of absurd hijinks along the way.

The series, which parodies the classic Rankin/Bass holiday specials, boasts a star-studded voice cast, including Seth Rogen as Santa, Maria Bamford, Nicholas Braun, Joel Kim Booster, Craig Robinson, and Gabourey Sidibe. With its raunchy humor and satirical take on gender roles and corporate culture, Santa Inc. delivers a holiday story unlike any other—one filled with equal parts festive spirit and no-holds-barred comedy.
