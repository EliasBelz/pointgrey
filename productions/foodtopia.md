## Description

Sausage Party: Foodtopia takes the raunchy, irreverent humor of the 2016 animated film Sausage Party and expands it into a full-fledged series. Premiering on Amazon Prime Video on July 11, 2024, the show picks up where the movie left off, with Frank and his fellow food comrades striving to build a utopian society free from human oppression. However, their vision of Foodtopia is soon shattered when a catastrophic flood forces them to seek an uneasy alliance with the very species they once defied. What follows is a wild and unpredictable journey filled with absurd humor, social satire, and plenty of food-based double entendres.

Developed by Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir, the series brings back the original film’s all-star voice cast, including Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, David Krumholtz, Edward Norton, and Scott "Diggs" Underwood. Joining the chaos are newcomers Will Forte, Natasha Rothwell, Sam Richardson, and Yassir Lester, who inject fresh energy into the series. With Rogen and Evan Goldberg as executive producers, Foodtopia continues the franchise’s signature blend of outlandish comedy and biting commentary on society, power, and the absurdity of existence.
