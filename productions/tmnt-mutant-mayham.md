## Four teenage turtles with ninja skills finally emerge from the sewers, only to discover that being heroes is messy when giant mutant bugs want to take over the world.

In *Mutant Mayhem*, the Turtles—Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello—have been hidden away by their father, Splinter, in the sewers for years. When they help April O'Neil, they step into the human world for the first time, making a name for themselves. But their first major challenge comes from Superfly, a mutant villain planning to turn every animal on Earth into mutants.

After a series of battles, Superfly becomes a giant kaiju, and the Turtles are misunderstood as monsters. With help from April, they fight back, but their victory is only temporary. Now, they must face the looming threat of Cynthia Utrom from TCRI, who is out for the Turtles—and they'll need to confront the mysterious Shredder to survive.
