## Three helicopter parents crash prom night to stop their daughters' sex pact, embarking on a wild odyssey of butt-chugging, blind texting, and awkward revelations about growing up.

When three lifelong friends make a pact to lose their virginity on prom night, their overprotective parents (John Cena, Leslie Mann, and Ike Barinholtz) discover their secret plan. Determined to stop them at all costs, the clueless yet well-intentioned parents embark on a wild and chaotic chase across town, leading to absurd encounters, unexpected revelations, and heartfelt lessons on trust and letting go.

Directed by Kay Cannon in her feature debut, *Blockers* is a raunchy yet surprisingly heartfelt comedy that flips the teen sex comedy genre on its head. With sharp humor, a strong cast, and an empowering message, this hilarious film is packed with laugh-out-loud moments and genuine emotional depth.
